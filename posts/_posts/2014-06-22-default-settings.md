The tech industry's monoculture is an issue for creating great global products. We, as members of the tech industry, should consider the wider implications of the monoculture we work within on the products we create and the people who use them. By limiting the kinds of people in our ranks we limit our understanding of people who use our products, and we limit our ability to deliver a great experience to the networked world.

## The startup industry is a monoculture

In 2012, the [CB insights study](http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/venture-capital/data-race-gender-silicon-valley-venture-capital-diversity) shows that founders of start-ups receiving Series A in the first 6 months of 2010 were 92% male, 87% white, 12% Asian, and 1% black. Additionally, in 83% of cases, every single member of the founding teams were white. Google's engineering team is (83% men and 94% white or asian)[http://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html]. The world on the whole is about 15% white, 54% Asian, 15% Black, 8% Hispanic and 8% Middle Eastern. With this much overrepresentation of white males, what communities are we underserving? What values are being naively pushed aside because they are not important to a privileged group?

## Tech products are Monocultures

While tech companies are not diverse, tech products are built of the principal of monoculture. A group builds a single version of a product to appeal to anyone who may use it. The perfect piece of technology is slightly too advanced, but accessible, to a less experienced person and slightly too simple, but acceptable, to a more experienced one. One product for all.

While this 'monoculture product' is convenient, it does not effectively serve the 2.5 billion people with internet access. The primary apps people use for search, shopping, chat and social networking are different in countries around the world and vary greatly between many demographics such as age and gender. Since our products cannot adapt, they are not as ubiquitous as they could be. The most common practice is creating different product for different countries — a google.jp or a google.ch. While practical, treating national borders as your product groups is a crude method helping your product reach a more diverse set of people. It isolates communities and only vaguely satisfies the needs of each group — causing them to easily jump to a service that does.

## Our apps, written in code, don't code switch like we do.

If we want our products to be our companions and their spaces to be our 'networked publics', we need to understand the diverse set of people who use our products. We need provide them tools to make our products feel like their home. Sadly, we don't know much about the people who use our products. There are few ways for people to express their preferences within the established online tools. And, due to network effects, people have few alternative spaces. Without the ability to choose a different Facebook or Twitter, the designers of these primary online spaces are imposing their values as the default values. Default aesthetics and settings presented as a thing of convenience but can (intentionally or not!) become a method of control, exclusion and normalization.

A urban teen may have a very different need for Facebook than your grandmother, and yet they see the same feed and start with the same settings. In a global world, those 'other people' aren't your cousin or your grandmother but are hundreds of millions of people from vastly different worlds. Although their voices are suppressed, that does not make them irrelevant. There are many valid ways for sharing content online, watching movies, practicing religion, reading etc. Different approaches are not "inferior alternatives" to the "correct" way -- they are just different. How do we design products that can accept people for who they are? How we design products that give people real choice without compromising ease of use?

## Next steps

One of the first steps toward creating great global products is talking about identity. Who are we and what do we believe? Would something I find convenient, make someone else unsafe. Anil Dash, in the context of a conversation on privilege in the tech industry, said the following:

> "One of the biggest challenges of being a minority is that talking about one's self or even indirectly revealing one's identity is seen as being uppity, reinforcing the idea that being a member of the white male minority is somehow a "default". By not talking about our identities (and by having powerful publishers/investors explicitly enforce the idea that we're not allowed to describe our identities), we perpetuate the homogeneity of tech culture."

Lets try to understand people not just to send them targeted advertising, but to provide them with a more targeted experience.
Lets talk about the 'identity' of the people who we work with.
Lets talk about the 'identity' of the people who use our products.
Lets look at our default settings.
