"Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.‚Äù - Eskimo saying

Debt is one of those big important things. Big in the sense that it encompasses everything from birthday 'gifts' to our trillion dollar national debt. Important in the sense that we can not and perhaps have never lived without it. It is more core to our society than the monetary debt we are all too familiar with -- and also much more interesting. Debt is what holds us, our friends and our families together.

## Origins of debt
The traditional narrative of debt begins after money has been 'invented'. After all, how can you be in debt without being able to accurately quantify what you owe?

Debt predates money and encompasses much more than favors or finances. For examples, a religion may ask you to make offerings to pay back your debt to god for being given life. In addition to higher powers, you also are born with a debt to the society that enabled you to safely do what you want to do and become who you want to be. And even closer to home, you are in debt to your parents and friends who made you who you are. None of these debts you can 'pay back' in any reasonable way but they remain as debts none the less.

The important part of this, known as "the primordial debt theory", is that debt is the fabric of our social being. Before markets or coinage ever existed, the debt and codependency of the debter-debtee relationship formed backbone of the gift economies of our early small living groups. Say I come home with a large animal, my wife may choose to distribute that meat to other families who have given us something previously. No need to write it down or be very formal about it. We are all in this together. This seems very exploitable today but actually worked well in small familiar living groups.

Bartering appears only when these small living groups brush paths. The economic theory of money is that money grows out of the need to barter more accurately and effectively. The narrative goes: a group barters with various goods, trading cows for chickens, for a while then things get too complicated so the group settles on one type of good as currency and money is born. That narrative never happened. Historically, people did not barter within the tribe and only with groups they will probably never see again. The history of formalized currently and bartering are actually entirely separate. Bartering did not come from money but from regularly encountering people outside your group.

Coinage comes much, much later - in the age of large governments with a very practical need to pay the soldiers and tax the populous. This pattern repeats itself over and over again across the various early empires of East Asia, India and Western Europe. The most fascinating, and perhaps overlooked consequence of the invention of coinage and formalization of debt is the ability to put a price on a human life. In addition to the people of conquered countries, the slave population began to include debtors from all walks of life, some temporary and some forever.

Today, when we think of money and debt, we think of our student loans, banks and credit cards but when they first coexisted, they were used to support 'the human economy'. When money was first used it was not to simplify trading goods but was an offerings to the gods, a dowery, bride wealth, slaves or to settle a blood-feud. One cannot offer any material possession in exchange for life - there is no equivalency, and yet money lets us try.

## The debt that can never be repaid
Unlike a 'payment' we think of today, money is then just an acknowledgment of a debt that can never be repaid. A third party may decide the price and the receiver is sometimes forced to accept the offer just so that life can continue safely. Instead of the more religious theory, "money emerges from the recognition of an absolute debt to that which has given you life", here almost everyone is in some absolute debt to someone else. One might even say that no, you don't have a 'debt to society' but that society is nothing but the accumulation and manifestation of these absolute debts we own each other but that can never be repaid. Society is then not us, but our debts.
