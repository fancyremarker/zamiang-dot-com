"Build something that people want" | "Chase the vision, not the money;
the money will end up following you." |"Donâ€™t worry about failure; you

doing." | "Trust your instincts." | "Never, never, never give up." |
"I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful
entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance."

These quotes are all pretty useless. This blog post is about some
little platitudes that have taken on some real meaning for me through
experience and now provide a framework for future projects.

## Build something you can make time for

Once, I started fundraising for a project. Due to many factors, we
launched a project before we were ready and fundraising failed. We had
not clearly explained the rather complex and technical mission and had
no clear 'ask' for our backers. The importance of both of those cannot
be oversold. A lively person succinctly selling you on both the
validity of their idea and the confidence in them to execute on that
is a real work of art in itself. Through the process, I gained
incredible respect for people who can no only put themselves out there
but do so in a way that is both articulate and fun.

It seemed like a great idea to launch alongside some windfall
press. The timing was almost right in that we did have a functioning
website, a system that mostly worked, and a kickstarter project ready
to go for funding the whole thing...but each of these items was far
from good. The other factor is that I was running out of money and
tired. I had been living off of unemployment for a couple years and
that was due to run out in about two months. I was unsure if we could
both make the project more substantial, and then run the project in
that time -- or if I should spend that time looking for a job. The
press looked like a shortcut, and was in the wake of Diaspora getting
funded, so we vastly overvalued this press opportunity and decided to
launch in order to capitalize on it. The fundraising failed.

Regardless of the success of that kickstarter, the broader project
was not in a position to succeed. We did not clearly understand what
would make our product useful to people, possess the skills to
productize it and were too wrapped up in the project to realize
it. Though certainly we could have acted in a riskier way and really
fought for its survival, we rushed to put out a bad project and the
project was rightfully unsuccessful.

## Build something that people can understand and want

This same project we created were fundraising for, was also a research
project in the HCI community. A research project is very different
from a 'real life' project. HCI is a truly wonderful community and
honestly the most thoughtful and welcoming group I have ever been a
part of. That said, I can't help but think the focus on creating
publishable results hinders your ability to create immediately useful
results. While trying to glean something generalize-able and
scientifically valid, you often miss or ignore feedback that would
help you create a useful product. While we asked many great research
questions, the bigger question we failed to ask 'is this something
that people both understand and want'.

There is something to be said for Amazon's 'Press Release Driven
Development'. Many mere panels of our large system are now million
dollar companies. For example, our system for creating rules such as
"when I get an email that contains urgent, text me that email" is a
natural language version of IFFT. We had a calendaring system for
displaying context around your upcoming calendar events - not unlike
Fantastical. The part I was most excited about, a way to view a
summary of your past, still is a nitche that has not been filled. A
system encompassing all of these things, particularly before there
were popular existing tools to relate them to, was just too much for
someone to understand and want. Maybe even more importantly, it was
something so large it was difficult to make any part of it truly great
- and the project as a whole, something that we could be proud of.

## Build something that you are proud of

After the research project I worked on ended, I went to be an early
engineer and designer at a very new tech company in NYC. In less than
a year it had dissolved. The saddest thing about is that I believe we
were addressing an important need but produced a product that was less
than the talent in the room. The quality of the final project wasn't
there and it failed to address the business needs. There were many
simple process that could have been put in place to create an
environment where we more intelligently reacted to business needs
and created a more desirable product.

In a startup it is easy to get caught up in the race. We lacked the
perspective to slow the hell down and ask what we were building. My
one wish is that we just took not just a day but weeks to stop
building and just think about if what we want to do mapped to what we
were actually doing. A vision is nothing, especially if it doesn't map
to what you are actually doing.

Thinking of your product as an element of someone's life. Where would
it fit in? I didn't have a clear sense for where the product would sit
and when it would be used.

My primary error was not clearly delegating and organizing my
responsibilities. I took on too much, as the designer, only front-end
engineer and, later, really only 'product person' although really
everyone was heavily involved in the project, it lacked an involved
leader. It was impossible for me to do a half good job at any of these
things and I should have more clearly communicated that.

## Learning from Failure

It seems so simple, but each of these projects failed when we got
tired. We were just exhausted from working on these problems for years
without seeing signs of 'success'. I am sure that with enough energy
and time, we could have made these projects financially successful and
something that we could be proud of. They are all projects that could
be at least be a well made project that financially supports a small team.

While each of these platitudes are great, the bigger issue is managing
you, and the team's energy. Life is short, people get tired. We all
run in the wrong direction for a while but we can only do it for so
long.
