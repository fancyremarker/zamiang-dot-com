"Build something that people want" | "Chase the vision, not the money; the money will end up following you." | "Donâ€™t worry about failure; you only have to be right once." |"Any time is a good time to start a
company." | "The way to get started is to quit talking and start doing." | "Trust your instincts." | "Never, never, never give up." | "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance."

These quotes are all pretty useless. This blog post is about some platitudes that have taken on meaning for me and now provide a framework for future projects.

## Build incrementally

Once, I started fundraising for a project a friend and I had been working on for a couple years. It seemed like a great idea to launch alongside some windfall press. The timing was almost right in that we did have a functioning website. We had a system that mostly worked, and a kickstarter project ready to go for funding the whole thing...but each of these items was far from good. The other factor is that I was running out of money. I had been living off of unemployment for a couple years and that was due to run out in about two months. I was unsure if we could both make the project more substantial, and then run the project before I ran out of money. The press looked like a shortcut. It was in the wake of Diaspora getting funded, so we vastly overvalued this press opportunity and launched. The fundraising failed.

Regardless of the success of that Kickstarter, the broader project was not in a position to succeed. We did not understand what would make our product useful to people, own the skills to productize it, and we were too wrapped up in the project to realize it. Though we could have fought for its survival, we rushed to put out a bad project and the project was rightfully unsuccessful. When the fundraising failed, it didn't feel like we had failed. We had already failed well before that by not getting people to use our product.

As a small team, we had a big app. The tech world is full of grand visions, but you are not going to build something to "radically transform" people's lives. People don't want their lives "radically transformed" -- they want them to be a little bit better. You may have a large long term plan but the first step is the most challenging - getting someone to love something you build. Keep it simple and incremental when improving the product. But, more importantly, think about how your product is seen as an increment on to a real person's real life.

## Build something that people can understand and want

This same project we created were fundraising for, was also a research project in the HCI community. A research project is very different from a 'real life' project. HCI is a wonderful community and the most thoughtful and welcoming group I have ever been a part of. That said, I can't help but think the focus on creating publishable results hinders your ability to create immediately useful results. While trying to glean something statistically significant, you miss feedback that would help you create a useful product. While we asked many great research questions, we failed to ask: 'is this something that people both understand and want'.

There is something said for Amazon's 'Press Release Driven Development'. Many mere panels of our large system are now million dollar companies. For example, our system for creating rules such as "when I get an email that contains urgent, text me that email" is a natural language version of [IFFT](https://ifttt.com/). We had a calendaring system for displaying context around your upcoming calendar events much like [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). The part I was most excited about, a way to view a summary of your past, still is a niche that has not been filled. A system encompassing all these things was just too much for someone to understand and want. It was something so large it was difficult to make any part of it truly great - and the project as a whole, something that we could be proud of.

## Build something that you are proud of

After the research project I worked on ended, I went to be an early engineer and designer at a new tech company in NYC. In less than a year it had dissolved. The saddest thing about is that I believe we were addressing an important need but produced a product that was less than the talent in the room. The quality of the final project wasn't there and it failed to address the business needs. There were many simple process that we could put in place to create an environment where we more intelligently reacted to business needs
and created a more desirable product.

In a startup it is easy to get caught up in the race. We lacked the perspective to slow the hell down and ask what we were building. My one wish is that we just took not just a day but weeks to stop building. We should take time to just think about if what we want to do maps to what we are doing. A vision is nothing, if it doesn't map to what you are actually doing.

My primary error was not delegating and organizing my responsibilities. I took on too much, as the designer, only front-end engineer, and 'product person'. It was impossible for me to do a half good job at any of these things and I should have more clearly communicated that.

## Learning from Failure

It seems so simple, but each of these projects failed when we got tired. We were just exhausted from working on these problems for years without seeing signs of 'success'. I am sure that with enough energy and time, we could have made these projects financially successful and something that we could be proud of. They are all projects that could be at least be a well made project that supports a small team.

While each of these platitudes are great, the bigger issue is managing you, and the team's energy. Life is short, people get tired. We all run in the wrong direction for a while but we can only do it for so long. It may seem efficient to keep moving but put the game on pause and go for a walk.

Are you testing your assumptions incrementally?
Are you building something people can understand and want?
Are you proud of what you are building?
