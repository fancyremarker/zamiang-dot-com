While I'm certain that a story of sexuality from a CIS gendered straight white dude is just not needed in the world, I'll leave this at least as a kinda therapy for me to move forward with greater clarity.

I read about the idea of sexuality stories in the latest issue of Adult Magazine, which is a pretty arty little magazine with writing and stories loosely about sex and relationships.

Writing about your past is a really great way to remember things. I'm very forgetful, particularly with names and dates so I actually have no idea what year this happened but probably when I was in 9th or 10th grade.

I mean how does this even go? Well, as with many people in the United States, I grew up in a relatively small kinda surburban town. A mostly segregated town in the south. Segregated in that special southern way where it isn't talked about even when learning about segregation in history class. There were, literally, tracks that you did not want to live on the other side of, but this is a driving city so you aren't exactly going to wander over there.

One time in high school I saw a girl who was pregnant get stabbed in then stomache with a switchblade (or something). The baby didn't make it. Many of the jock-y white dudes went hunting before school and left their guns in the car. One didn't like the principal so the principal had his car searched and he got expelled. There were tons of other guns in other cars in a post columbine world.

But, this is a sexuality story
