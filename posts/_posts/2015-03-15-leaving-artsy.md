So, I left Artsy 3 months ago.

I begun to focus more and more on the impact question. Financial security is nice but "success" is helping create something culturally important. With that change in the definition of success comes a change in career path. While I believe in the mission of Artsy, to make the world's art accessible, I feel that I am able create more value outside of Artsy. With that in mind, the decision to leave Artsy was very clear. Leaving a great job is a difficult decision, but not if you put the change in perspective.

At Artsy, I was on the CTO career track in the role of "Director of Web Engineering". I love enabling people to do their best work. It is so fulfilling to parallelize projects across a team so that we deliver great products and keep the team learning and growing. Leadership is something that was new and incredibly stressful for me in the beginning but something that I now love. Worked closely with design to realize innovative ideas. Responsible for making sure Artsy's public facing web presence is fast and maintainable Ensured that we meet external project deadlines for large engineering projects such as art fairs and auctions.

Some of the more concrete accomplishments began with taking Artsy out of Beta into a public site. As the newly public website expanded, I helped build our first forays into [art fairs](https://www.artsy.net/art-fairs), [live auctions](https://www.artsy.net/auctions), [editorial feed](https://www.artsy.net/posts/featured) and a [site](iphone.artsy.net) for launching our iPhone app. While those were all public facing accomplishments, I am most proud of the behind the scenes work that made our team more happier and more productive. We spoke at [Node on the Road](https://www.joyent.com/developers/videos/node-js-on-the-road-nyc-craig-spaeth-brennan-moore) about the process of moving our team from a slow monolithic app to a fast site that is easy for the team to maintain and move forward. The foundation of this was set by [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock) pushing us towards an API driven architecture from the beginning and [@craigspaeth](https://twitter.com/craigspaeth)'s development of [Ezel](https://github.com/artsy/ezel). After that was done, I feel comfortable moving on with the team on track to get even better.

All that said, I feel incredibly lucky to have been a part of such an awesome team for 3 years. I grew a lot and was able to accomplish things I will always make me proud. A few days ago I sent this note to the Artsy CEO as thanks.

> I just can't stop thinking about the Artsy team. Since parting ways, I met few people who are high quality enough to work at Artsy. While it has only been a few months, it just further validates that you have done an incredible job putting together a great team. Artsy instilled strong values, pushed me to grow tremendously and fostered lifetime level friendships. I know it isn't enough, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you!

> It is a bit sad to be cheering from the sidelines now but, I'm very much still cheering!
