I left Artsy 3 months ago.

Since leaving, many friends reached out to see how it is 'on the other side'. This post is a condensed version of those conversations.

## Leaving a dream job

If all the talk about millennials is to be believed, are a generation that respects creating value over creating wealth. Financial security is nice but "success" is helping create something culturally important. With that change in the definition of success comes a change in career path. On this 'other path', I hope to help create something that improves peoples lives. With that in mind, the decision to leave Artsy was very clear. It did not align with my career path and mission. Leaving a great job is a difficult decision, but not if you put the change in perspective.

At Artsy, I was on the CTO career track in the role of "Director of Web Engineering". I love enabling people to do their best work. It is so fulfilling to parallelize projects across a team so that we deliver great products and keep the team learning and growing. I helped build our first forays into art fairs, auctions and other new verticals. I am most proud of moving our team from a slow monolithic app to a fast site that is easy for the team to maintain and move forward. This is due to [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock) pushing us towards an API driven architecture from the beginning and [@craigspaeth](https://twitter.com/craigspaeth)'s development of [Ezel](https://github.com/artsy/ezel). After moving to a series of micro services, things were good and it was time for me to move on. There are huge engineering nightmares out there that need my help more than Artsy.

As far as mission, working in the arts does not have as much social impact as it may seem. It would be amazing if more people had the financial and social support to be able to freely express themselves. But, there are many systems of exclusion in the gallery art world and in society that need to be broken down before that can happen. I would much rather help address those issues at their core than help the existing systems function efficiently. This hit home for me in December when the Eric Garner protests were happing concurrently with Art Basel Miami. The art world should be a safe place for people to express and explore but was not a part of those conversations. It is so self absorbed and slow that it is culturally irrelevant.

All that said, I feel incredibly lucky to have been a part of such an awesome team for 3 years. I grew a lot and was able to accomplish things I will always make me proud. A few days ago I sent this note to the Artsy CEO as thanks.

> I just can't stop thinking about the Artsy team. Since parting ways, I haven't worked with a single person (ok *maybe* one) who is high quality enough to work at Artsy. While it has only been a few months, it just further validates that you have done an incredible job putting together a great team. Artsy instilled strong values, pushed me to grow tremendously and fostered lifetime level friendships. I know it isn't enough, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you!

> It is a bit sad to be cheering from the sidelines now but, I'm very much still cheering!


## Finding what is next

The decision to move on was easy for me, a dude working in tech with no real responsibilities in my life. I 100% would have stayed if I had a family or perhaps worked in a different industry. I would have been 'kinda happy' with that life, but that is not what I want. Now is the time to search for high-impact, fulfilling work. There are basically no career risks in tech since everyone needs website help for their revolutionary business venture. Leaving your job isn't a risk as an engineer since you are almost literally falling into piles of money.

After making the decision to leave, it took about 6 months to actually move on. First, I tried to try build time in to my day to listen to myself. Taking a next step requires having a direction. I slowly tried absolve myself from responsibility and used that time to read, listen, write. I tried blogging about a few areas that interested me. If you can't blog a few thousand words about an area, you probably aren't that interested in it (ht Anil Dash). Meet people - Do I know anyone who knows anyone who work in those areas? I tried to build a few starter projects and use them and what I had written help get coffee with people in the industry. Having created something already, it made conversations at meetups very easy and transactional. After using a project to start conversations, I could freely ask more abstract conversations to learn more about what it is like to actually work in the industry. It is about at this time that I had the confidence to move on.

### tl;dr for moving on from your current job
1. Listen
2. Read about the area
3. Write about the area
4. Meet people in the area
5. Try working with people in your spare time
6. ???
7. Profit… or at least be more happy

This strategy has helped me transition out of the Art world and into advertising, then from advertising to tech. Currently, I am using it again to leave 'startups' to help cities better serve the needs of their citizens. I hope to eventually find a fulltime role in this area. Currently, in this iterative process, I've been spending my time freelancing, working on [Vislet](http://www.vislet.com/) and am beginning a new project looking at gerrymandering.
