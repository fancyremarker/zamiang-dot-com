3 months ago, I left Artsy. After over 3 years at the company, it was an incredibly difficult decision to leave a role that defined my life for so many years and helped define my values as an engineer.

As the Director of Web Engineering, I was responsible for making sure Artsy’s public facing web presence was fast and maintainable while meeting external project deadlines. After spending years doing front-end engineering at Jumo and MIT CSAIL, I was surprised to find that my favorite part of the job was enabling people to do their best work. It was so fulfilling to parallelize projects across a team so that we could deliver great products and keep the team learning and growing. Leadership was new to me and, though incredibly stressful in the beginning, became something that I now love.

I was fortunate enough play a role it taking Artsy from a closed beta to a public site. As the newly public website expanded, I helped build our first forays into [art fairs](https://www.artsy.net/art-fairs), [live auctions](https://www.artsy.net/auctions), [editorial](https://www.artsy.net/posts/featured) and a [site](http://docs.google.com/iphone.artsy.net) for launching our iPhone app. These included some fun moments like deploying the site from coat check at our first live auction (which BFA [documented](http://bfanyc.com/home/photo/920761?search_resource=person&person_id=133939)) and many far less glamorous long nights and weekends.

While it was exciting to be a part of such public-facing projects, I am even more proud of the behind the scenes work that made our team happier and more productive. We spoke at [Node on the Road](https://www.joyent.com/developers/videos/node-js-on-the-road-nyc-craig-spaeth-brennan-moore) about the process of moving our team from a slow monolithic app to a fast site that is easy for the team to maintain and move forward. The foundation of this was set by [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock) pushing us towards an API driven architecture from the beginning and [@craigspaeth](https://twitter.com/craigspaeth)’s development of [Ezel](https://github.com/artsy/ezel). Tests went from taking 2-3 hours to taking about 10 minutes, eliminating the frustration of breaking the build. Deploy cycles went from taking almost half a day to about 15 min, which built tremendous confidence in the team. Since we could fix things more quickly, people told us about more problems. An employee jokingly told me the team works so fast that they can push new features before he can even conceptualize how they would be built.

After that transition was complete, site stability and productivity were no longer top concerns. I felt comfortable stepping back a bit to reassess and focus on my long term goals. After spending so much time at Artsy I developed a real fascination with using technology to help cities function more efficiently. I am now looking forward to spending time developing some of these side projects such as [vislet](http://www.vislet.com/).

All that said, I feel incredibly lucky to have been a part of such an awesome team for 3 years. I grew a lot and was able to accomplish things I will always make me proud. A few days ago I sent this note to the Artsy CEO as thanks.

> I just can’t stop thinking about the Artsy team. Since parting ways, I met few people who are high quality enough to work at Artsy. While it has only been a few months, it just further validates that you have done an incredible job putting together a great team. Artsy instilled strong values, pushed me to grow tremendously and fostered lifetime level friendships. I know it isn’t enough, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you!

> It is a bit sad to be cheering from the sidelines now but, I’m very much still cheering!
