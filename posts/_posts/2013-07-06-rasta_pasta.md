This is an awesome, easy to make and surprisingly tasty dish I made
the other day. Spaghetti w/ sausage meets Hot Fire Sauce, lime and
cilantro. It is a pretty solid mix of flavors with a good personality
and it takes as long to make as your pasta takes to cook.

**Cooking + Prepr Time**: 15 min
**Le Ingredients**

- 1 serving of pasta
- 2 links of sausage
- little garlic
- awesome hot sauce (Rasta Hot Fire totes obve!)
- cilantro
- BASIC tasty tomatoe sauce w/ little personality
- salt (always!)
- 1 actual lime (NOT CRAP LIME JUICE!)
- 'fresh' parmesean (not required)
- hot peppers (not required...if you don't want this dish to be tasty)

Note: Since I live in Williamsburg, I am obligated to tell you all
ingredients should be locally sourced or home grown, and all leftovers
should be composted. And...put a bird on it.

Lets party.
Start boiling the water.

Put some oil in the pan and toss in the chopped garlic w/ a little hot
sauce. After that is nice and cooked, toss in the chopped up sausage
and add a bit more hot sauce. Chill out for a second. Squeeze all the
lime juice into the pan. Yup. Chill. Add the cilantro and maybe add
some frozen veggies (I am lazy). Cover the pan. Chill some more. If
the spagetti is about done then add the pasta sauce to the sausage mix
and maybe add a few more spices, italian seasoning and salt. When the
pasta is done, STRAIN IT then combine everything in the pan.
