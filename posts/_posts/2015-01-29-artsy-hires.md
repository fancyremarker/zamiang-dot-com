# How Artsy Hires

If Artsy has a secret sauce, it is how it hires. All else falls from the assumption that they have hired the best people who want to work together to achieve Artsy's mission. Based on the [Netflix slides](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) where 'adequate performance is met with a generous severance package', there is nothing in here about dealing with 'adequate performance'. Unlike in the Netflix slides where there is little actual practical advice - more 'hire the best' good luck! *push*. Here are actual things you can do to hire great people.

## Identify great people
- Know how to mine your networks. [Is a good list](http://firstround.com/article/Mine-Your-Network-for-Early-Stage-Hiring-Gold)
- Meet with the best candidates and mine *their* networks on Twitter, Tumbler etc.
- Write a great job posting that emphasizes challenges, ownership, opportunities for growth and quality of team. Qualify with fundamentals and values (not overly specific experience requirements like 'must have x years of experience).
- Get in front of the people you want to hire through Open Source, blogging, speaking and press.

## High Touch Outreach
- Ask first degree connections for an introduction whenever possible.
- Invite the contact to something casual like a team event.
- If a candidate comes to an event, email the team a headshot and description. Ask for feedback from team members who talked to them.
- For intro emails, make sure to write a thoughtful email indicating unique qualities of the individual. Make sure to leave a positive impression of the company since they may know other people who may want to work with you. Keep it high touch.

## Evaluate with consideration of your Bias
-  The best predictor of future performance is past performance.
  - Initial Screen = Data on past performance
  - Interviews = How well someone interviews
  - References = Data on past performance
- Biggest mistake: Relying on the interview

It is very difficult to tell good from great in an interview especially in creative or technical roles where interviews are an artificial environment that doesn't compare to how they create value day to day.

Biases
- Valuing intuition over historical data
- Valuing people who are similar to you

## IRL Time: The interview
The goal is merely to see whether to move on to references. Interviews only test how well someone interviews. They are, however good for answering a few key things:
- Answering questions about past experience
- Disqualifying based on 'culture fit' - Only for *very bad* culture fit. Interviews are an artificial environment.
- Selling the company and position
- Checking about progress (Sometimes less experienced candidates won’t bring up deadlines and make decisions without giving a heads up.)

Keep in mind that interviews should always be a positive experience. Interviews are relatively short with 4 team members getting about 30 min to 1 hour each and then a lunch / dinner / group event. PM is responsible for making sure people don't all ask the same questions. Directly after interviews, each interviewer follows up with a clear yes or no with detail.

Evaluate feedback from interviewers and move to references only if the candidate seems awesome for the role.

## References. The secret weapon
The biggest mistake most companies make is not calling references or doing them half-ass. References are not a defense against hiring poorly, they are a way to hire great people. Additionally, references are an important touchpoint for the company since you are reaching out to senior people at other organizations.

The primary goal is to see if the candidate is an inspiring person to work with. The second goal is to sell the reference on the company since they could become an investor, client or refer other people.

Start the reference calls easy by thanking them and letting them know how valuable their feedback is. Give them some context for the company and the job. Then start with easy questions like 'what are your general thoughts on x'. Next, don't ask "How was working with x?". Ask "Purely in terms of *performance*, how would you rank X out of everyone you’ve worked with in a similar position? What was the difference between X and the #1?". Follow that question for *team work*. The rankings are forced and awkward but valuable. Sometimes prompt the reference with a number you expect to be lower and they will often followup with a closer number and why. Do not end after this question. Followup with questions about what motivates the employee, why did they leave, what to they need to be happy… etc. Finally, thank the reference and ask if they have any questions. Take notes immediately afterwards.

Weigh the feedback but also weigh the strength of the individual giving it. Some organizations have consistently awesome people, and some don't -- make sure to take that into account. Know who these companies are for your industry.

## Close
Are they truly one of the best in the world or is this a compromise? Would you be more excited to come to work if they were here?

If your answer isn't a 'hell yes!' here, go back to the drawing board. It is painful to work with people who aren't in it 100% and who you don't really like working with. 

### Passing on a candidate
Reject candidates just as thoughtfully as you have been hiring them. This is consistent with the values of the company and is generally the right thing to do.

### Making an offer
Congratulate them and let them know just how awesome they are and why people were so excited to work with them. Emphasize specific things people have said about them throughout the process -- including references.

Make the offer in detail on the phone and then followup in writing.

#### Compensation
This is not an opportunity to try to get the most out of a person for the least amount of money. Salary negotiators are unfair and inconsistent with any organization that values actual human beings. 

Compensation is a function of the value of the candidate based on market rate, the value the company brings to the candidate (hopefully something!) and the market in between.

Collect data on market rate by responding to recruiter emails asking saying something like 'I have a friend who might be interested… but what is the comp?'. Candidates should be asked to also submit market data. The company should not us negotiating tactics and instead focus on finding fair compensation.

### Close, Close, Close
It is a long road to decide whether to hire someone or not. Once you have decided, focus 100% on actually closing. Make sure you have contact information for everyone involved in the hiring process as you may need to reach out to them for support in closing the deal.
- Reenforce the why's of the company and position
- If they don't accept, seek to understand why and offer support
- Bring in support from the team. Have them meet with more team members or investors if necessary. Invite them to events.
- Identify the root cause and see of you can solve this. Sometimes this a significant other - offer to speak with / send an email that can be shared with the other party.

If they accept, send a personalized package with handwritten note, swag and anything you think might generally interest the candidate errr… new hire! Congrats.
