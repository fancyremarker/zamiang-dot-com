People talk a lot about "culture fit" and hiring "people you want to
hang out with". Identifying engineers who are motivated, knowledgeable
and good at working on a team is already difficult enough, why further
complicate the hiring process with these abstract metrics.

Lets hire people to do what they love doing. Maybe instead of thinking
about jobs in terms of technical expertise, like 'front end', 'back
end', 'systems', we can talk about what gets people excited.

In today's (relatively) high level programming world, engineers should
have a level of comfort across the stack. Once patterns and code
standards are somewhat well established, a 'css person' should feel
comfortable editing the database models or working on an API and
submitting a pull request (if not, your team or codebase has much
bigger problems).

We have high level programming languages, why not give people
high-level job titles?

Here are a couple of examples of 'high-level' job titles that come to
mind:

__Tooler__: building tools to make the jobs people more effective at what
they do. This spans the the whole company. You just really love using
technology to make people's jobs more efficient.

__Growth-hacker__: while this title is certainly 'in vogue', it is a
perfect example of a high-level job title. Your job spans product and
engineering, you do whatever it takes to encourage 'growth', however
that is defined for your project.

__User focused__: people who love buildings stuff that people use. I'd
probably fall in to this category, basically you are someone who will
do whatever it takes to get a great product in front of the people.

__The academic__, some people love correctness and broad sweeping design
patterns. These are the people who love designing frameworks and APIs
for other engineers to work with.

__The tuner__, you love making stuff fast. Performance is a very important
feature with 'on the go', mobile lifestyles and the global
marketplace. Whatever the task, you want to make sure it doesn't take
very long.

While these names are pretty off the cuff, at least lets acknowledge
that great things happen when you get smart, passionate people
together with diverse perspectives. You can put together that team
more effectively if you understand not only the different technical
specialties of programming, but the different *types* of programmers.

## Job titles at Artsy

I am one of about 15 engineers at Artsy.net. Everyone is just an
engineer here and some people 'own' various technical components but
even that gets murky sometimes as people go through their performance
cycles. People generally work on what they want to work on. By having
such an open ended working process, we've seen these types of roles
emerge. As the team grows, if we need to formalize roles, it would
feel unnatural to give people titles like 'lead front-end engineer'. I
don't know what that means for us. We have an gallery CMS, a mobile
site, a desktop site and internal tools, each with their own
'front-end'. As a company, we think in terms 'KPI's we want to keep in
line and features we want to build for our users. Roles and
responsibilities work best if company priorities align with who is
going to 'own' that project. This limits the needs for heavy handed
project management and allows our engineers to simply do what they
love while happening to build a great product.

Cheers to 'high level' programming titles. This is really just an idea
at this point, I'm sure it has its own set of issues. Please let me
know if you have tried something similar.
