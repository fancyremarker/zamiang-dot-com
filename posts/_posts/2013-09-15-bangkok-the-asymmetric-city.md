So, how do you like to travel? Maybe car, back of a truck, bus, bike,
back of a bike, cycle, tuck tuck, train, boat., how about that bright
pink cab over there. On your journey you roll by a Rolles Royce
dealership followed by a man passed out in his tin shack on the
canal. The car drives past some shaded guilded temples, glancing down
the tree lines streets to see a neon sign for "Sexy Cunts"; perhaps
reconsider your desire to grab a ping pong game. The painted lines on
roads seem like some out of place western formality, offering little
more than a suggested path for the vehicular milue. Sitting in traffic
you watch a woman welding girders under a "we build what you dream"
sign while street side, a man is carefully weaving flower
bracelets. Unable to infer the gender of the motorcycle driver out
your window, you close your eyes and enjoy the strange sounds of thai
man singing Katy Perry's California Girls on the radio. Still sitting
in traffic, your bored driver whips out a his iPad to show you
Instagrams from his latest travels. You follow each other and he tells
you it would probably be faster to walk. You get out of the cab in
middle of the street.

You walk to some ornate century old gilded temple with an unfamiliar
name. With no desire to be closer to the heavens, they are not too
tall, almost squished by the shadows of surrounding
skyscrapers. Walking past the entrance your see a new form of
chivalry, a man using his girlfriend's shopping bags to shield her
from the sun as they walk between shopping malls. The skinny sidewalks
usually enforce a slow, relaxed walking pace on the sightseeing
masses. Perfect for the bag salesman, juice lady and monks all trying
to 'make a dollar out of 50 cents'. You must be getting ripped off so
you pass by, take off your shoes and enter the temple. The only
seating is a sort of ornate elevated wooden platform beneath a golden
glow. "For monks only". FoMO you think. The empty red carpet creates a
very humbling seating expense, with no unneeded luxuries. These little
details, the lack of shoes, loose comfortable garments, really seem to
encourage detachment. Very refreshing to just be comfortable and happy
with so little. At least until, a text comes in from your worrying
parents, checking if you are alive in this far, far away place.

Bangkok, an asymmetric city and an asymmetric experience - and a truly
memorable one.
