I left Artsy 3 months ago.

Since leaving, any friend why was unhappy in a job wanted to chat and see how it is 'on the other side'. This post is a sort of condensed version of those conversations.

We are a generation that respects creating value over creating wealth. Financial security is nice but "success" is helping create something culturally important. With that change in the definition of success comes a change in career path. On this 'other path', I hope to help create something that improves peoples. With that in mind, the decision to leave Artsy was very clear. It did not align with my career path and mission. Leaving a great job is a difficult decision, but not if you put the change in perspective.

## Leaving a dream job

As far as career path goes, I was on the CTO career track in the role of "Director of Web Engineering". It is an exciting path for me. I love enabling people to do their best work. It is so fulfilling to parallelize projects across a team so that we deliver great products and keep the team growing. I helped build our first forays into art fairs, auctions and other new verticals. I am most proud of moving our team from a slow monolithic app to a fast site that is easy for the team to maintain and move forward. This is due to @dblock pushing us towards an API driven architecture from the beginning and @craigspaeth's development of Ezel. After moving to a series of micro services, things were good and it was time for me to move on. There are huge engineering nightmares out there that need my help more than Artsy.

As far as mission, working in the arts does not have the social impact that I long for. It would be amazing if more people had the financial and social support to be able to freely express themselves. But, there are many systems of exclusion in the gallery art world and in society that need to be broken down before that can happen. I would much rather help address those issues at their core than help the existing systems function efficiently. This hit home for me in December when the Eric Garner protests were happing at the same time as Art Basel Miami. The art world should be a safe place for people to express and explore but is so self absorbed and slow that it is irrelevant.

All that said, I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of such an awesome team for 3 years. I grew a lot and was able to do some things I am proud of and moved on. A few days ago I sent this note to the Artsy CEO as thanks.

I just can't stop thinking about the Artsy team. Since parting ways, I haven't worked with a single person (ok *maybe* one) who is high quality enough to work at Artsy. While it has only been a few months, it just further validates that you have done an incredible job putting together a great team. Artsy instilled strong values, pushed me to grow tremendously and fostered lifetime level friendships. I know it isn't enough, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you!

It is a bit sad to be cheering from the sidelines now but, I'm very much still cheering!

## Finding what is next

As a young person with no real responsibilities, now is the time to search for what you want to do. This is especially easy to do as a web engineer. There are basically no career risks since everyone needs website help for their revolutionary business venture. Leaving your job isn't a risk as an engineer since you are almost literally falling into piles of money. Now is the time to take those "risks".

More personally speaking, I tried to give myself time to listen to what I'm interested in. Build in time to read, listen, write. What are the problems that I am interested in solving.

Right now I feel a bit at a wall. As an individual, there doesn't appear to be much I can do on a civic level with my limited knowledge and experience.


In the mean time, I am freelancing (perhaps the source of another blog post). Freelancing certainly isn't something I enjoy in the slightest but


Over the past few months I have been working to transition into a new industry.
Many of the projects I've worked
