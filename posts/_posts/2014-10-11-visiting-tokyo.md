This is a quick run down of my experience visiting Tokyo for the first
time. I really just wanted to see what it would be like for me, a
white dude, to live in the city. As a result, I focused on a smaller
area where I would see myself living & working (Shinjuku &
Minato). Instead of visiting things to goggle at japanese subcultures,
I just did the stuff I like. I am not Japanese, nor were many of the
people I hung out with and I don't speak the language. I'm am just
trying to see if I can live and learn in a wildly different place,
while remaining myself. So, ya know, take those perspectives into
account.

While fairly westernized, Japan is truly another world from the United
States end to end. From the cute little construction cones to
virtually every social custom to a wholly different philosophy for how
you treat the space around you. The differences and their nuances are
often astounding. Its common for white dudes to ask other white dudes
'do you ever think you could become one of them'. Even if I wasn't a
tall white dude, no amount of time would allow me to
'assimilate'. That is such an incredibly wrong (and probably
frustrating!) mindset for living in Tokyo or anywhere your racial
makeup will forever mark you an outsider. Just be nice, don't try to
be Japanese.

## Getting around Tokyo
Get a bike in Tokyo. The city has near-scandanavian level bike
accommodations. There are big organized sidewalks and traffic on the
roads goes at a bikeable speed. If you are familiar with biking and
driving, it is really a no brainer. The benefits are simply that you
learn the city instead of the train stations. Tokyo is incredibly
cavernous and is easily discoverable on a bike where you can quickly
stop to investigate some curiosity down an alleyway. For navigating, I
was able to use google maps cache and the iPhone GPS (which still
works). There are some strange rules about where you can lock your
bike but generally just try to lock it up near other bikes. Last bit
of advice, just remember to sing 'to the left, to the left' pretty
much all the time.

## Drinking

Bar culture is very american / european creation. Each asian country
certainly has its history with alcohol but they incorporate 'bar
culture' into existing traditions in wildly different ways. It seems
like the differences are either reflection of when they modernized or
massive marketing campaigns. In Hong Kong, bar culture is fresh and is
mostly for the older or foreigner crowd. In Thailand, bar culture was
imported as bottle service clubs with live music (idk). Since
foreigners don't usually order bottle service, Thai clubs occasionally
charge a 'foreigner fee' and unwittingly serve them beer. In Tokyo,
drinking happens in all kinds of waysâ€¦ except at dinner. Bars often
try to build their own culture since they have a dedicated clientele
from doubling as stores or coffee shops during the day. We had many
interesting experiences, a bars seem to just push to some extreme of
'bar-ness'. Were kicked out of a very quiet whisky bar for laughing
and then went to a bar where buying a drink allows you to pick the
next song - a drunkards dream jukebox.

Public drinking is generally ok in Asia. One of my favorite moments
from the trip was on a 9am train to Hakone, we sat next to a group of
old men who accumulated a crew and more beers as we went along. All
well dressed and just quietly having a great time as they drank their
way to the onsen.

# Interesting policies
Ok so this is a totally strange section. One of my favorite things to learn about are social policies that are somewhat unique to the area.

## Jay Walking
There is no jay walking except at night. But, when someone jay walks
on an empty trthe whole crowd follows -- no one wants to be that 1st
person to break the rule.

## Trash
Basically, it costs money to throw stuff away. Throwing away a desk
costs about $50 USD. This changes purchasing behavior and encourages
reuse. If there is anything I would want to take from Tokyo to the
USA, it would be this policy.

## Building height restrictions
Tokyo is easily the most livable city I've ever visited and building
height restrictions are a huge part of that. Unlike cities with
limited space (like hong kong or Bangkok), Tokyo is an interesting
reference for a large city like Brooklyn. My guess is that building
height restrictions creates even population density around the
city. Even density encourages even transportation coverage across the
city via Buses or wide bike able sidewalks.

## Tangible Media
This place loves paper and buttons more than any place I've ever
seen. Does make it feel like some 80s future closer to Brazil than
Blade Runner. Next to every 20 in touch screen which can display any
UI imaginable... is about 20 (very well made!) buttons which interact
with the screen. Nicer and less touristy places tend to be cash
only. Ramen machines take cash and dispense yet another piece of
paper! These days it would be trivial to have an integrated paperless
system. Absurd.

# Basic travel tips
- Get a MiFi from the airport. About $20 a day from one of the cell stations
- Make sure your Credit Card has a chip and a pin number
- Get cash (errebody loves cash here)
- [Prepaid subway](http://www.jrpass.com/blogs/benefits-of-prepaid-travelcards) cards are very nifty
- Get some whisky in the airport for roughly 1/2 the price in the states. Gary recommends the [Yoichi 20 year](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/yoichi-20-year-old-whiskey/) but I personally prefer the [Hibiki 21 year](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/suntory-hibiki-21-year-old-blended-whisky)
- Tip is included
- 'To the left to the left'
