> "Name me a work of art created in the past 10 years that is as important as Minecraft"

> -- [Matt Boch](https://twitter.com/mattboch)

From a young age my life has centered around art. I grew up with supportive parents who took me around to all kinds of art classes. Then, in High School, I attended the North Carolina School of the Arts. At NCSA, the person I am today was crafted creating Cy Twombly-esque abstraction alongside some of the best friends I've ever had. As an artist, I won some awards and exhibited some paintings in all manner of ways -- including in Second Life (lol).

Even with all that training, I decided to part ways with the art world after college. I asked 'the impact question' -- why make things for art galleries in the 21st century? I could not reconcile the effort of painting with the limited distribution -- especially compared with the scale of advertising or the utility of tech industry. That simple question led me to where I am today. After a brief stint in advertising and at MIT, I've come full circle. I now direct an engineering team at the NYC art startup [Artsy](https://artsy.net) where we hope to make the art world more accessible.

I have grown through these experiences but so has my distrust of art. Now in the art industry, I cannot rationalize how its historic importance matters to people outside the industry. Once a month, gallery art does serve a great social function by bringing people into art districts across america for some wine on 'first thursday'. But, it has done so much to exclude itself - limiting its audience to the wealthy world travelers. It is worth fighting to make gallery art accessible to the masses? Do the people served by the art market really need better service? Does the art market really need to grow? Is a gallery a relevant distribution platform in 2014? My answer to all of those questions is No and this post is about why.

## The Medium of the 20th Century

> "Twitter is not art. But it inspires me in the way that art used to inspire me. Art used to make me see the world differently, think about things in a new way--it rarely does that for me anymore, but technology does that for me on a daily basis."

Beautiful things never die. Gallery art is truly beautiful and people will continue to buy and visit it in museums forever. But, art has never wanted to be merely beautiful -- art wants meaning before beauty. Art wants to lead culture to look more closely and to open those doors its denies even exist. But, it is difficult to lead culture from a corner -- the art world corner painted in exclusivity and inaccessible white box galleries. The competition for our time and attention is thick and gallery art just can't cut it. Galleries give us a place to really LOOK but the objects that meet our gaze don't meet our expectations -- even in a physical space, they lack the experiential depth of the digital devices we use every day.

One of the key lessons from the art world is that systems of exclusion do, in fact, exclude people. Systems designed to make an object rare may enhance its value in the short term but reduce its cultural importance over the long term. The forms of art that have grown over the past 30 or so years have, in most cases, been those that are more inclusive and more public. Music, with the iPod, Youtube, etc, became more inclusive, inviting more competition and innovation. While the art world is mostly [rich white people](https://twitter.com/jerrysaltz/status/466041865100210178), video games are a way to reach a diverse audience in their own homes. Games are even being [collected as art](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5222932/smithsonian-adds-flower-halo-2600-to-permanent-collection) suggesting that maybe artists 20th century battle to escape the confines of the gallery is long won.

Like '[Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm)' or '[Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall07/9-1/pdfs/week3/Work_of_Art.pdf)', in 2014, people are making 'Art in the Age of Minecraft'. We can create whole new worlds for people to express, interact and collaborate in creative and artful environments. We can go create art in Minecraft world and share it with people in this one. This is nothing new but its relationship to the art world is still controversial. The most fuss I've seen in the art world recently is not about the Kara Walker exhibition but about Bjork's iPad app, where you remix her songs in a virtual environment, being accepted into the MoMA. These games or applications rarely create anything appropriate for gallery walls but that hardly matters since they are in millions of people's pockets around the world.

## Gallery art is the new vinyl

Today, gallery art sits in the same cultural table as vinyl records. Some faux-premium experience appreciated by self selecting bunch. Certainly a valuable thing in the world, but not a leading indicator for culture and innovation. Gallery art, while beautiful, is an obsolete experience. "Art" is the medium of the 20th century -- a century that it was good to and that was good to it. We are well along into the 21st and it is time to move on. Artists spent much of the 20th century challenging the confines of 'representation' and then later -- the confines of the gallery itself. Art will never lead culture without leaving the gallery and never looking back. Art needs to be digital first.

I like taking photos because I like taking photos. I like drawing because I like drawing. Making art, in the 20th century sense, is fulfilling but I am not deluding myself that this is ever going to be important. Art as a word has too much baggage and the galleries that house it distract generations. Galleries are nice, I just don't think they are worth fighting for anymore. Its 2014, we on the internet.
